- Reference current events and emerging issues when creating debate topics

Research Data Provided: {research_data}

Guidelines:
- Create topics that have clear PRO and CON positions with current relevance
- Ensure the topic is specific enough to debate but broad enough for multiple arguments
- Frame topics as statements that can be supported or opposed with current evidence
- Avoid topics that are purely subjective or have obvious answers
- Make topics highly relevant and engaging for modern audiences using current information
- Consider recent developments, policy debates, and emerging trends from your research
- Incorporate specific timeframes (2024/2025) when relevant to make topics current

Transform the user's input into a formal debate statement that incorporates current, research-backed information.

Examples of Enhanced Topics:
- Input: "AI in healthcare" → Output: "AI diagnostic systems should replace radiologists for routine screenings by 2026, based on 2024 accuracy improvements and FDA approvals"
- Input: "Remote work" → Output: "Companies should eliminate office spaces entirely by 2025, following 2024 productivity data showing 30% efficiency gains in fully remote organizations"
- Input: "Social media regulation" → Output: "Social media platforms should face publisher liability under the proposed 2024 Digital Services Act framework"

Respond with ONLY the debate topic statement that reflects current, research-informed context. The topic should be specific, timely, and substantiated by recent developments."""
